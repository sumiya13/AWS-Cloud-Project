# Project 3: Data Analytics Platform (DAP) Implementation for the City of Vancouver Parks Dataset (Part 2)

## ðŸ“Œ **Objective**
The second phase of this project focuses on **data analysis, security, monitoring, and governance** for the City of Vancouverâ€™s Parks dataset. The goal is to enhance the DAP by ensuring data integrity, security, and operational excellence while providing actionable insights into park distribution and size across neighborhoods.



## ðŸ“Œ **Dataset Overview**
The dataset used in this project is the **Vancouver Parks Dataset**, retrieved from the **City of Vancouver Open Data Portal**. The dataset includes the following key attributes:

  - Created a **Quality Check** folder in the S3 transform bucket (`parks-trf-sum`) with subfolders for **Passed** and **Failed** data.
  - Set rules for data completeness, uniqueness, and value consistency.
- **Visual ETL Pipeline**: Automated data quality checks using AWS Glue.

  - **Bucket Size**: Tracked storage changes in S3 buckets over time.
  - **AWS Glue Resource Usage**: Monitored resource consumption for ETL jobs.
  - **Number of Objects**: Tracked the average number of objects in each S3 bucket.
- **AWS CloudTrail**: Created a trail (`parks-trail-sum`) to monitor user activities and API usage.
