# Project 3: Data Analytics Platform (DAP) Implementation for the City of Vancouver Parks Dataset (Part 2)

## ðŸ“Œ **Objective**
The second phase of this project focuses on **data analysis, security, monitoring, and governance** for the City of Vancouverâ€™s Parks dataset. The goal is to enhance the DAP by ensuring data integrity, security, and operational excellence while providing actionable insights into park distribution and size across neighborhoods.



## ðŸ“Œ **Dataset Overview**
The dataset used in this project is the **Vancouver Parks Dataset**, retrieved from the **City of Vancouver Open Data Portal**. The dataset includes the following key attributes:

This is the DAP Implementation design part that we implemented for 'parks' dataset


### **1. Data Analysis**
- **AWS Athena**: Used to analyze the dataset and answer key questions about park distribution and size across neighborhoods.
  - **Business Problem 1**: Total number of parks per neighborhood.
  - **Business Problem 2**: Average park size per neighborhood.
  - **Business Problem 3**: Top 5 largest parks in Vancouver.
  - **Business Problem 4**: Comparison of neighborhoods with similar park counts but different park sizes.

### **2. Data Security**
- **AWS Key Management System (KMS)**: Created a custom key (`parks-key-sum`) for encryption and decryption.
- **S3 Bucket Encryption**: Enabled default encryption for all S3 buckets (`parks-raw-sum`, `parks-trf-sum`, `parks-cur-sum`) using the custom key.
- **Bucket Versioning**: Enabled versioning to track changes and ensure data integrity.
- **Replication Rules**: Created replication rules to ensure data availability across multiple locations.

S3 Bucket Encryption and Versioning



### **3. Data Governance**
- **AWS Glue DataBrew**: Used for data quality checks and validation.
  - Created a **Quality Check** folder in the S3 transform bucket (`parks-trf-sum`) with subfolders for **Passed** and **Failed** data.
  - Set rules for data completeness, uniqueness, and value consistency.
- **Visual ETL Pipeline**: Automated data quality checks using AWS Glue.

### **4. Data Monitoring**
- **AWS CloudWatch**: Created a dashboard (`parks-MCR-sum`) to monitor:
  - **Bucket Size**: Tracked storage changes in S3 buckets over time.
  - **AWS Glue Resource Usage**: Monitored resource consumption for ETL jobs.
  - **Number of Objects**: Tracked the average number of objects in each S3 bucket.
- **AWS CloudTrail**: Created a trail (`parks-trail-sum`) to monitor user activities and API usage.
